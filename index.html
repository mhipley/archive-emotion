      <h1>Notes on an archive</h1>
      <p>        
        When we return to a familiar moment in the past, the view widens as we grow ever more distant. New topologies form.</br>
        Sometimes this shape gifts us deeper understanding, but sometimes we see something that was never real. </br>
        There is nothing solid in sand.</br>
        Maybe archiving is a way to remember that gives safe haven from the distorting flow of time. </br>
        Archives shelter ephemera, and trace a familiar outline around the fragments within to give them form. Archives find a way to make sense of the past.</br>
        This is how the archive becomes a stable location, to which we can look and reorient ourselves.</br>
        It becomes a firm foundation from which we can take flight, because archiving is time travel.</br> 
        When our drifting memories are transfigured into a fixed record, the archive becomes a place we can return to - even though we know thereâ€™s no way back.</br>
        As the past prints the future into the present, this portal also goes forward. The archive is an object through which a message can be sent.</br>
        Within a future, in all the din, there will be one more beacon.</br>
        He was here, and I loved him.</br>
