        <h1>Notes on an archive</h1>
        <p>
          When we return to a familiar moment in the past, the view widens as we
          grow ever more distant. New topologies form.<br />
          Sometimes this shape gifts us deeper understanding, but sometimes we
          see something that was never real. <br />
          There is nothing solid in sand.<br />
          Maybe archiving is a way to remember that gives safe haven from the
          distorting flow of time. <br />
          Archives shelter ephemera, and trace a familiar outline around the
          fragments within to give them form. Archives find a way to make sense
          of the past.<br />
          This is how the archive becomes a stable location, to which we can
          look and reorient ourselves.<br />
          It becomes a firm foundation from which we can take flight, because
          archiving is time travel.<br />
          When our drifting memories are transfigured into a fixed record, the
          archive becomes a place we can return to - even though we know there's
          no way back.<br />
          As the past prints the future into the present, this portal also goes
          forward. The archive is an object through which a message can be
          sent.<br />
          Within a future, in all the din, there will be one more beacon.<br />
          He was here, and I loved him.<br />
